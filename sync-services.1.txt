== NAME ==

sync-services - Sync services between several hosts

== SYNOPSIS ==

sync-services [ options ]

== DESCRIPTION ==

+sync-services+ could be used to synchronized several similar configuration
files on multiple hosts. This is mainly useful when administrating a cluster
from which configuration files are not globally stored on a filer.

== ARGUMENTS ==

-d DIR, --config-dir DIR::

   The configuration directory to be used instead of default one which is
   './.sync-services'.

-c CONF, --config CONF::

   The configuration file to be used instead of default one which is 'config'.

NOTE: The configuration file is *relative* to the configuration directory.

-r, --dry-run::

    Only print what would be done.

-v, --verbose::

    Run in verbose mode.

-h, --help::

    Print help screen.

== CONFIGURATION FILE ==

The configuration file is located by default in './.sync-services/config'.

A configuration file must be present for +sync-services+ to run.

The configuration file consists of +bash+(1) variables which syntax is as
simple as:

    VARIABLE="VALUE"

=== General options ===

ips::

    This is a space separated list of servers that should be synchronized together.

NOTE: At this moment only IP addresses should be specified, not hostnames.

WARNING: IP addresses of all members from the cluster had to be defined. This
means even IP address of current member must be set.

run_parts::

    Path to +run-parts+(8) binary. By default this is hard-coded to *$(which
    run-parts)* and shouldn't be changed.

ssh::

    Path to +ssh+(1) binary. By default this is hard-coded to *$(which ssh)*
    and shouldn't be changed.

ssh_opts::

    Options to be passed to +ssh+(1).

rsync::

    Path to +rsync+(1) binary. By default this is hard-coded to *$(which
    rsync)* and shouldn't be changed.

rsync_opts::

    Options to be passed to +rsync+(1). By default set to *-aie ssh --stats
    --delete --progress* which may be a little chatty.

forbidden_dirs::

    Regexp defining directories that *mustn't* be synchronized. By default
    '^/$|^/lib/init/rw|^/proc|^/sys|^/dev' to exclude:
    - /
    - /lib/init/rw
    - /proc
    - /sys
    - /dev

NOTE: This is not a good idea to run +sync-services+ from those directories.

=== hooks ===

Hooks can be run ad different moment from the synchronization process:

pre_update_hook::

    This hook is ran on *local* host *before* the synchronization process
    starts. This hook is generally a good place to generate configuration
    files from scripts or to restart the service on local host.

post_update_hook::

    This hook is ran on *local* host *after* the synchronization process
    starts. This is ran when all hosts are synchronized.

pre_update_remote_hook::

    This hook is ran on *remote* host *before* the synchronization process
    starts for this specific host. This is generally a good place to ask
    user confirmation before going on on remote host.

post_update_remote_hook::

    This hook is ran on *remote* host *after* the synchronization process
    starts for this specific host. This is generally a good place to restart
    the service on remote host.
