== NAME ==

sync-services - Sync services between several hosts

== SYNOPSIS ==

sync-services [ options ]

== DESCRIPTION ==

+sync-services+ could be used to synchronized several similar configuration
files on multiple hosts. This is mainly useful when administrating a cluster
from which configuration files are not globally stored on a filer.

== ARGUMENTS ==

-d DIR, --config-dir DIR::

   The configuration directory to be used instead of default one which is
   './.sync-services'.

-c CONF, --config CONF::

   The configuration file to be used instead of default one which is 'config'.

NOTE: The configuration file is *relative* to the configuration directory.

-I, --ips IPS::

   Space-separated list of IPs to sync instead of all.

-i, --init::

    Initialize configuration directory and exit.

NOTE: This option is only run if no configuration directory is found.

-r, --dry-run::

    Only print what would be done.

-v, --verbose::

    Run in verbose mode.

-h, --help::

    Print help screen.

== CONFIGURATION FILE ==

The configuration file is located by default in './.sync-services/config'.

A configuration file must be present for +sync-services+ to run.

The configuration file consists of +bash+(1) variables which syntax is as
simple as:

    VARIABLE="VALUE"

=== General options ===

ips::

    This is a space separated list of servers that should be synchronized
    together.

NOTE: At this moment only IP addresses should be specified, not hostnames.

WARNING: IP addresses of all members from the cluster had to be
defined. This means even IP address of current member must be set.

includes::

    A +bash+(1) array of all files and/or directories to include during the
    synchronization process. This options useful when for some application
    that use configuration files in several paths.

[NOTE]

====
For example, application +foo+ is using '/etc/foo.conf' as the main
configuration file and '/etc/foo.d' for some configuration snippets. In
addition the '/etc/default/foo' and '/etc/init.d/foo' files should also be
synchronized to other hosts. Put +sync-services+ configuration files under
'/etc/foo.d' and add in '.sync-services/config':

   includes=("/etc/foo.conf" "/etc/default/foo" "/etc/init.d/foo" )


Included files might need to be deleted first on remote host in a
*post_update_remote_hook* (see below).
====

run_parts::

    Path to +run-parts+(8) binary. By default this is hard-coded to *$(which
    run-parts)* and shouldn't be changed.

ssh::

    Path to +ssh+(1) binary. By default this is hard-coded to *$(which ssh)*
    and shouldn't be changed.

ssh_opts::

    Options to be passed to +ssh+(1).

sync::

    Command used to synchronize files. The string '@@IP@@' is expanded to the
    target host ip address.

[NOTE]

====
A very simple and efficient command could be:

  rsync --archive -i--relative --stats --delete --progress ${includes[*]} @@IP@@:/

If root connections are forbiden in remote host then following command could
be used:

   sudo -E rsync --archive --itemize-changes --rsh="ssh ${ssh_opts}" \
   --relative --stats --delete --progress --rsync-path "sudo rsync" \
   ${includes[*]} `id -un`@@@IP@@:/
====

forbidden_dirs::

    Regexp defining directories that *mustn't* be synchronized. By default
    '^/$|^/lib/init/rw|^/proc|^/sys|^/dev|^/etc$' to exclude:
    - /
    - /lib/init/rw
    - /proc
    - /sys
    - /dev
    - /etc

NOTE: This is not a good idea to run +sync-services+ from those directories.

=== hooks ===

Hooks can be run ad different moment from the synchronization process:

pre_update_hook::

    This hook is ran on *local* host *before* the synchronization process
    starts. This hook is generally a good place to generate configuration
    files from scripts or to restart the service on local host.

post_update_hook::

    This hook is ran on *local* host *after* the synchronization process
    starts. This is ran when all hosts are synchronized.

pre_update_remote_hook::

    This hook is ran on *remote* host *before* the synchronization process
    starts for this specific host. This is generally a good place to ask
    user confirmation before going on on remote host.

NOTE: This command is run *before* the synchronization process. Thus files might
not be present on remote host.

post_update_remote_hook::

    This hook is ran on *remote* host *after* the synchronization process
    starts for this specific host. This is generally a good place to restart
    the service on remote host.

[NOTE]

====
If some files are included using the *includes* statement the following command
could be used in '.sync-services/post-update-remote/10remove-included-files' to
move files in target directory

    #!/bin/sh
    
    sudo rm -rf /path/to/be/synced
====


== HOW DOES IT WORK ==

+sync-services+ is designed to be run directly in the directory to be
synchronized. The configuration files must be located in the directory that
should be synchronized under the '.sync-service' directory.

+sync-services+ looks up for all IP address on localhost that are on a IPv4
global scope and remove all local IP addresses from 'ips' configuration
entry (that's why host names does not work yet).

Then the 'pre_update_hook' is run.

For each IP addresses from 'ips' but local:

  - The 'pre_update_remote_hook' is run on *remote* host through a +ssh+(1).

  - The local directory is synchronized to the remote host using command
    defined in 'sync'.

  - The 'post_update_remote_hook' is run on *remote* host through a
    +ssh+(1).

Then the 'post_update_hook' is run.

== BUGS ==

No time to include bugs, command actions might seldom lead astray
user's assumption.
